0,Simulation and Rendering of Pitting Corrosion,Simulation and rendering of material weathering is of great interest in computer graphics as it facilitates modeling of realistic objects in virtual scenes. We present a physio-chemically based methodology to model pitting corrosion. Our simulation has ...
1,Scene Adaptive Cosmetic Makeup Transfer,"Cosmetic makeup is an art in itself which people use to often enhance their beauty and express themselves. Putting on makeup is a tedious task, so who would not love to see themselves in makeup before physically applying it? In this work, we demonstrate ..."
2,Compression of Noisy Depth Image using Planes,"This paper investigates compression of depth images – particularly, noisy depth images – captured by depth sensors like Kinect. Our scheme is based on incrementally detecting planes in depth images and then storing the plane parameters instead of the ..."
3,Unsupervised discovery of activity correlations using latent topic models,Topic models such as probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been successfully used to discover individual activities in a scene. However these methods do not discover group activities which are commonly ...
4,Immersive environment for robotic tele-operation,"In various modern day situations, controlling a robot from a remote location is essential due to hazardous environmental conditions (for human operators) near the robot. Thus arises the need for an intuitive user interface for tele-operation, which must ..."
5,Mixed reality based interaction system for digital heritage,User interfaces that leverages vivid computer graphics and virtual reality technologies provide effective means for exploring and inspecting cultural artifacts. Such virtual inspection systems help experience and disseminate cultural heritage. For such ...
6,User guided generation of corroded objects,"Rendering of corrosion often requires pain-staking modeling and texturing. On the other hand, there exist techniques for stochastic modeling of corrosion, which can automatically perform simulation and rendering under control of some user-specified ..."
7,A grammar-based GUI for single view reconstruction,"This paper presents a novel grammar-based GUI with an integrated back-end engine that enables accurate single view reconstruction with minimum supplementary information from the user. Our grammar allows a dynamic symbolic capture of constraints, which ..."
8,Optimized Offloading Using Local Clusters,This paper explores the process offloading in Mobile and Wearable devices to optimally use computational and power resources. It proposes the Performance and Energy Models over multiple devices to quantify the benefits and assist the decision to ...
9,A counterexample in congestion control of wireless networks,One of the triumphs of wireline network research of the last decade has been the casting of the Internet congestion control problem within an optimization framework based on utility functions. Such an approach provides a sound understanding of the ...
10,On the θ-coverage and connectivity of large random networks,"Wireless planar networks have been used to model wireless networks in a tradition that dates back to 1961 to the work of E. N. Gilbert. Indeed, the study of connected components in wireless networks was the motivation for his pioneering work that ..."
11,Towards optimally exploiting physical layer information in OFDM wireless networks,Wireless communication is inherently vulnerable in nature and packets can be corrupted due to various reasons. The network performance can potentially be improved if one is able to identify the reasons for packet corruption and react to them ...
12,Experimental investigations into TCP performance over wireless multihop networks,The results of an extensive experimental study of the performance of the TCP protocol over wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks are presented. The investigations are performed in a real indoor environment over a network of laptops equipped with off-the-...
13,Capacity bounds for ad hoc and hybrid wireless networks,"We study the capacity of static wireless networks, both ad hoc and hybrid, under the Protocol and Physical Models of communication, proposed in [1]. For ad hoc networks with <i>n</i> nodes, we show that under the Physical Model, where signal power is ..."
14,SEEDEX: a MAC protocol for ad hoc networks,"Motivated by the poor experimental scaling reported in a study of the performance of ad hoc networks in [15], we propose a new protocol for media access control in ad hoc networks. Our protocol seeks to avoid collisions without making explicit ..."
15,Admission control and scheduling for QoS guarantees for variable-bit-rate applications on wireless channels,Providing differentiated Quality of Service (QoS) over unreliable wireless channels is an important challenge for supporting several future applications. We analyze a model that has been proposed to describe the QoS requirements by four criteria: ...
16,Simultaneous learning of concepts and simultaneous estimation of probabilities,
17,Learning stochastic functions by smooth simultaneous estimation,"To learn, it suffices to estimate the error of all candidate hypotheses simultaneously. We study the problem of when this “simultaneous estimation” is possible and show that it leads to new learning procedures and weaker sufficient conditions for a ..."
18,Maximizing the functional lifetime of sensor networks,The functional lifetime of a sensor network is defined as the maximum number of times a certain data collection function or task can be carried out without any node running out of energy. The specific task considered in this paper is that of ...
19,Distributed energy aware cross-layer resource allocation in wireless networks,"In this paper, we consider the joint scheduling, routing and congestion control mechanism in [4] while incorporating a comprehensive physical layer model that considers both primary half-duplex constraints and the power-SINR-rate relation, and ..."
